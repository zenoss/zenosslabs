Monitoring an SNMP-Enabled Device
==============================================================================

The following sections will describe a common approach to monitoring an SNMP-
enabled device. We'll start with the basics that can be done without writing a
line of code, and then move on to more sophisticated capabilities.

For purposes of this guide we'll be building a ZenPack to support a NetBotz
environmental sensor device. This device has a variety of sensors that monitor
temperature, humidity, dew point, audio levels and air flow.
